            <p>I'm not trying to be different. To me, I'm just being myself.I take a lot of pride in being myself.
                I'm comfortable with who I am. Myself I Am Pride. Everyone has a right to their own opinion about me,
                and that's fine.</p>

        <h2>My Recipies</h2>
        <p>Cooking with kids is not just about ingredients, recipes, and cooking. It's about harnessing imagination,
            empowerment, and creativity</p>

                <h3>Recipie Title</h3>
                <p>I hate the notion of a secret recipe. Recipes are by nature derivative and meant to be shared that
                    is
                    how they improve, are changed, how new ideas are formed. To stop a recipe in it's tracks, to label
                    it
                    "secret" just seems mean.</p>
